            <p><h4>Step Five: <small>Change the website's header to The Playground instead of Alex's Playground because that sounds creepy and nobody wants to be on Alex's Playground.</small></h4></p>
                
            <p><h4>Step Six: Add a Step Five, but keep adding more steps ahead of it so it gets pushed down to Step... wait, what number was it again?</h4>
                <p>Also, while making these steps, try to buy a domain for this website.</p>
                <p>Try to buy <a href="theplayground.com">theplayground.com</a>, realize it's taken, and buy <a href="nottheplayground.com">nottheplayground.com</a>. After buying the domain, realize that sounds like it could be mistaken as something else because everyone is a pervert and nothing is sacred or innocent anymore.</p>

            <p><h4>Step Seven: Take a break to eat and go to sleep. Come back to this later. Otherwise, it will be morning next time I get up.</h4></p>

            <p><h4>Step Eight: Come back the next day.</h4>
                <p>Now that I've gotten some sleep and I've thought about it... "The Playground" seems kind of creepy. I tried to look for another domain like "The Sandbox" or something, but I've had no luck with that. I might just be stuck with "The Playground" for now.</p>
            </p>
            
                <p><h4>Step ??: Add some pictures to the website.</h4>
                <p>It's always great to have some pictures. Let's come back to this. <!-- FIXME: ADD SOME PICTURES WITH THIS WEBSITE https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_images.asp
