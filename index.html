            <p>I probably, most likely, but maybe definitely will not add something else to this website. I wish I could think of more to add to this quote so I could see what the blockquote does in Bootstrap 4. Maybe I will think of something after playing with the website a little longer. Also, it'll probably be easier to add to this quote after taking a break. Maybe I'll start a GitHub repository and practice integrating it into Visual Code Studio then I'll write about it on the website blockquote. After I write it, I'll go back and correct myself to write Visual Studio Code and wonder why I keep reversing those two words. Maybe I'll ponder why they even named it like that in the first place for a little whike and make a few more typos that I maty or may not go back and fiz.</p>

            <h3>Did I hear someone ask how this website came about?</h3>
            <p><small>No? Probably not, but I'll tell you anyway.</small></p>
            <p>Initially, I came to get on my computer so I could find out if I was accepted to the job I applied for. Thanks to my A.D.D. (I didn't have periods between the letters and it just looked like add, so I ADDED periods. See what I did there?), I somehow ended up on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. I started reading about Bootstrap 4 and started this website to test it out. After Step Six, I realized I should've started from the very beginning, but I was too lazy to go back and change the steps, so I'm just rolling with it at this point.</p>
